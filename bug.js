In a Firebase project, data is structured in a tree-like format.  If you attempt to access a nested property that doesn't exist, you won't get a helpful error message; instead, your app might crash or produce unexpected behavior. For instance, consider this code:

```javascript
const snapshot = await getDoc(docRef);
const city = snapshot.data().address.city;
```

If the `address` or `city` property is missing, `snapshot.data().address.city` would return `undefined`, and further operations on `undefined` can lead to unexpected behavior.  This is particularly difficult to debug because there's no direct error from Firebase.
