To address this, always check for the existence of nested properties before accessing them.  Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for concise and safe access.  Here's how you can fix the code:

```javascript
const snapshot = await getDoc(docRef);
const data = snapshot.data() || {}; // Handle null snapshot
const city = data.address?.city ?? 'Unknown'; // Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing
```

This revised code ensures that:

1.  If `snapshot.data()` is null, an empty object `{}` is used instead. 
2.  Optional chaining (`?.`) safely accesses `city`, returning `undefined` if `address` or `city` is missing. 
3.  Nullish coalescing (`??`) provides a default value ('Unknown' in this case) if `city` is `undefined` or `null`. 
This pattern prevents unexpected errors and provides a more robust and error-tolerant application.
